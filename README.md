My portfolio website

My project is a portfolio/resume site, where I can introduce myself to potential employers by outlining my professional experience, education, and skills. The site is coded mobile first, and uses flexbox to adjust both the <nav> and <main> content for wider devices. On wider devices, the navigation menu switches from vertical to horizontal and the text is enlarged for the biggest screens. The main content (about me, experience, and education) shift from one column to two on larger screens. My webpage also includes a contact form so site visitors may submit general questions or booking inquiries. For the contact form, the "fullname" input field requires validation in order for the form to be submitted, and once submitted, the user recieves a message confirming submission. 

The three required features that I can included are: 
1. A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes, such as by switching between vertical and horizontal, or is opened by clicking the “hamburger” menu item.
2. Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views. For example, swapping from a single column layout to a two-column layout on desktop.
3. Create a form (such as a ‘Contact Us’ form), validate at least 1 input (example, ensure email is in the proper format), and then use that information on your page somehow (ex: display it back to the user, or change a setting on the page based on a section). 

Other features I included are:
1. Use “:nth-child” or “nth-of-type” to style a series of elements on your page - for example, change the background color for every other row in a table.
